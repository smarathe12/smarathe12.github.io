		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>My name is Siddharth Marathe. I am currently a sophomore studying computer science and bioegnineering at UC Berkeley. I am excited about finding innovative solutions through wearables and software to help patients deemed "uncurable" find some relief. Apart from my academic interests, I love to hike, and play and watch football and basketball. Go 49ers!!</p>
